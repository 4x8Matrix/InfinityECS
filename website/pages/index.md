### What is ECS?
ECS stands for Entity-Component-System, an architecture designed for high performance & simplicity.
ECS and OOP (Object-Orientated-Programming) share some of the same attributes, however ECS prioritises structure & data orientation

There are thee factors when using an ECS system;

- Component: A property, state or value, as an example; we could add a Force Component to push an object.
- Entity: A collection of components, entities would be instances inside of the world.
- System: The logic used to compute what happens with Entity and it's collection of components

### What is Infinity?
