# World Class
The world class is essentially a container for all systems, entities and components, the world class will push events, handle system clocks and manage the environment of your project. 
Imagine the world being a space, inside this space will be your systems & entities which work hand-in-hand together in order to achieve something.

Another way of looking at a world, would be a Unity Scene, it allows you to store a package inside of one container, this container can then be manipulated in the future.

!!! Info 
	If roblox is the environment the framework is being ran in, then the World class will be constructed during runtime of the Infinity Module.
	For more information please visit `Classes` -> `Infinity`
