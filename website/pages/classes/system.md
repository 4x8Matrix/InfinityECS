# System Class
An system is one of the three elements that build the ECS architecture; This class provides logic for the entities & components inside of the world. An example of this would be; Updating an AI Pathfinding Algorithm to push a block to the next point in 3D Space.

!!! Warning
	A system class needs to have a world; Without a world this system can no longer manipulate any entities or components
	It is very bad practice to create a system and use it as a service, api or an object to be used inside of Infinity.
