# Service Class
A service is more of a standalone system; It's purpose is to provide you with ways to easily add functions & properties in world systems, for an example; You might want to create a Sound Service to manipulate and handle how sound would occur in your project.

!!! Info
	Using a system as a standalone service is very bad practice, a system is not designed for that usage, however, a service is.
